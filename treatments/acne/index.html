                                        <p><strong>Acne</strong>, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder of the sebaceous
                                            glands characterized by comedones and blemishes, and is often a hereditary
                                            trait which is also triggered by hormonal changes.</p>
                                        <p>Acne is caused by physical changes in the sebaceous follicles (oil glands)
                                            and develops through several stages. Initially a sebaceous follicle gets
                                            plugged with sebum (skin oil) and dead cells from the inside the follicle
                                            forming a comedo (or a plug).</p>
                                        <p>When a comedo is open and visible it is often called a blackhead because of
                                            its blackish appearance. A closed comedo is often called a whitehead (a
                                            small skin colored bump).</p>
                                        <p>Blackheads and whiteheads can turn into nodules, solid and irregular shaped
                                            lesions, characterized by inflammation and pain. If the nodule gets infected
                                            it turns into a cyst, a sac-like lesion containing liquid or semi-liquid
                                            pus.</p>
                                        <p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2945"

                                            often requires time to resolve. Even after acne resolves or improves,
                                            continued treatment is recommended to prevent reoccurence.</p>
                                        <p>Bacteria in the follicles are anaerobic. This means they cannot live in the
                                            presence of oxygen. When follicles are blocked with sebum and dead skin
                                            build-up, oxygen cannot reach the bottom of the follicle, resulting in
                                            bacteria growth.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Adult acne</strong> is often caused by the overproduction of sebum,
                                            an oil created by the skin&#8217;s sebaceous glands. It travels up hair
                                            follicles to the surface of your skin to act as a lubricant for the hair and
                                            skin.</p>
                                        <p>When excess sebum is produced, it can mix with dead skin cells to clog pores,
                                            trapping bacteria underneath.</p>
                                        <p>Pimples occur when the trapped bacteria cause inflammation or infection
                                            within the blocked pore. (source: Mayo Clinic).</p>
                                        <p>For some adults, breakouts are a result of hypersensitivity or overproduction
                                            of androgens (male hormones). But an imbalance in both male and female
                                            hormones (estrogen) can also cause breakouts.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Acne Rosacea</strong> features all of the conditions found in
                                            rosacea, in addition to presence of papules, pustules, and, in some cases,
                                            the fosteringof parasitic microorganisms (mites). While these may resemble
                                            acne, blackheads are absent and burning or stinging may occur.</p>
                                        <p>The adolescent mite dermatitis and early symptoms of rosacea are frequently
                                            misdiagnosed as adolescent acne. 90% of the adults and teenagers acne is
                                            caused by Demodex mites, 10% is bacterial.</p>

                                        <p>The change of the hormones makes the sebaceous glands produce more sebum,
                                            making the facial skin a perfect living and breeding place, they can now
                                            easily multiply and this is translated in infections and acne. (source:

                                        <p>The cause of acne is actually toxins and wastes that build up inside the body
                                            that cannot be properly eliminated. The body has several
                                            &#8220;normal&#8221; methods for expelling these toxins, through the liver,
                                            kidneys, colon, small intestine, and other organs.</p>
                                        <p>However, if any of these organs are weak and can&#8217;t handle the load, or
                                            if the buildup is too great or too rapid, acne can results.</p>
                                        <p>If one suffers from acne it is the body&#8217;s way of saying that there is a
                                            toxic build-up which the liver is unable to clean and the skin shows the
                                            imbalance.</p>
                                        <p>One can start by easing the load of the liver by drinking lots of water,
                                            eating a balanced diet and regular exercise. Regular saunas and steambaths
                                            help to flush out toxins from the body.</p>

                                        <h2>Acne triggers:</h2>
                                        <p><strong>Hormonal changes:</strong> Menstruation, pregnancy, time of menses or
                                            menopause, oral contraceptives and emotional stress lead to hormone changes
                                            which can induce skin breakouts. Abnormal hormonal imbalance can trigger
                                            sebaceous glands to secrete too much oil. The oil clogs pores, bacteria
                                            arrive, inflammation occurs and acne appears.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Genes:</strong> Acne can be hereditary. A child whose parents have
                                            acne is more likely to be affected by acne also.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Candida/yeast overgrowth:</strong> The balance between good bacteria
                                            and yeast is very important because if this balance becomes unbalanced (due
                                            to things like stress, alcohol, chronic antibiotics use, nicotine, tap
                                            water, parasites, hormonal imbalance, drugs and medication) then the Candida
                                            is allowed to flourish and grow out of control making you sick.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Stress:</strong> Stress triggers the body to produce certain hormones
                                            and increases the levels of harmful toxins in the body that can aggravate
                                            acne. Get sufficient sleep, regular exercise and clean your skin from
                                            within.</p>

                                        <p><strong>Medication:</strong> Some medications that contain drugs like
                                            Bromides, Lithium, Corticosteroids, and etc. have been proven to trigger
                                            acne. Certain birth control drugs (those that contain only progestins) can
                                            also interfere with hormonal production.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Pressure or friction</strong> from rubbing or touching the face,
                                            phone use, or wearing hats can contribute to acne breakouts. Dirty pillows
                                            or makeup brushes can also transfer bacteria to the face.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Environmental factors</strong>: Pollution, humidity, and the sun can
                                            all affect the skin negatively and provoke an acne problem.</p>
                                        <p><strong>Personal care products</strong>: Oily lotions, sunscreens or hair
                                            products can aggravate acne.</p>
                                        <p>Untreated acne can leave scars.</p>
