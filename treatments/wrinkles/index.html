										<h2>Wrinkles/Aging</h2>
										<p>As we age <strong>wrinkles</strong> appear on our face and body. Although
											wrinkles can signify wisdom, we would rather not have them. Most wrinkles
											appear on the parts of the body where sun exposure is greatest.</p>
										<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-2663"
												src={{ "/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/wrinklesgraphic.jpg" | relative_url }} alt="" width="324"
												height="218"
												sizes="(max-width: 324px) 100vw, 324px" /><strong>Aging</strong> of the
											skin is a very complex and a gradual natural process. There are two factors
											in the aging process: &#8216;<strong>internal</strong>&#8216;, programmed in
											our genes and &#8216;<strong>external</strong>&#8216;, caused by external
											harmful factors (sun damage, smoking, stress, vitamin deficiency, alcohol,
											hormones, air pollution and many others).</p>
										<p>With age skin cells divide more slowly and the inner layer (dermis) begins to
											thin. The number of the superficial skin cell also decreases , about 10% per
											decade. Collagen production gradually slows down resulting in decreasing of
											the skin firmness.</p>
										<p><strong>Aging skin</strong> is less able to retain moisture and oil-secreting
											glands produce less sebum (skin oil). All these changes make the skin dryer,
											thinner, less elastic and cause it to wrinkle and sag.</p>

												height="236" /><img class="wp-image-2969 alignnone"

										<p>&nbsp;</p>
										<p><strong>Wrinkles/Aging</strong> it is lines from <strong>internal</strong> or
											<strong>external</strong> causes. Stress, our life style, even our attitude
											can contribute to our skin&#8217;s health. Free radicals in the body,
											dehydration, vitamin deficiency, improper nutrition, alcohol, caffeine,
											hormones and menopause all affect our skin&#8217;s well-being.</p>
										<p>Typical signs of <strong>external aging</strong> are <strong>sun
												spots</strong> (especially on face, hands and neck), premature
											<strong>wrinkles, sallow skin color, loss of tone</strong> and
											<strong>elasticity</strong>, and <strong>broken capillaries</strong>.</p>
										<p>Unfortunately, sun damage shows up at the same time as menopause &#8211; a
											double attack on woman&#8217;s outermost layer. Hormonal imbalances can lead
											to sensitivity, dehydration, hyperpigmentation, and micro-circulation
											problems that affect capillaries.</p>
										<p>Additionally, lack of exercise, lack of rest/sleep, smoking, medications, and
											drugs have negative effects, inside and out.</p>
										<p><strong>Aging of the neck</strong> is a complex process and may have
											significant variation from person to person. Some people loose the tone and
											texture of the skin as well as underlining connective and fat tissue. On the
											other hand others seem to accumulate extra fat tissue with age.</p>
										<p>Unprotected sun exposure and hormonal changes are the most powerful factors
											contributing to neck aging.</p>
										<h2>What should I do to avoid wrinkles?</h2>
										<p><strong>Eat:</strong> foods which contain antioxidants such as blueberries,
											strawberries, apples, tomatoes, spinach, cabbage, beetroots etc along with
											foods that contain omega-3 fatty acids.</p>
										<p><strong>Drink:</strong> it keeps your skin hydrated. Excessive alcohol
											consumption can lead to puffy skin which sags later on.</p>
										<p><strong>Don&#8217;t smoke:</strong> Collagen and Elastin are responsible for
											keeping our skin firm and supple, smoking affects this collagen thereby
											causing wrinkles. Smoking also causes reduction in the blood supply, which
											directly translates into less oxygen being supplied to the skin, thinning
											the skin process. Second hand smoke can cause wrinkles too.</p>
										<p><strong>Don&#8217;t stress:</strong> Chronic stress is known to cause
											premature wrinkling.</p>
										<p><strong>Avoid too much Sun:</strong> Exposure to the sun&#8217;s UV rays is
											one of the major causes of wrinkles. The UV rays speed up the aging process
											by breaking down Collagen and Elastin which are needed to keep the skin firm
											and supple.</p>
										<p><strong>Remember:</strong> Deep wrinkling is not associated with the normal-
											or internal- aging process: fine lines are normal, deep wrinkles are not.
											The sun&#8217;s UVA rays penetrate deeply into the dermis and cause the
											breakdown, disorganization and cross-linking of collagen.</p>
										<p>Although it is impossible to reverse aging completely, there are many ways to
											prevent premature aging and improve the appearance of aging face. It is
											crucial to maintain a healthy life style, quit smoking, and wear sunblock
											with SPF 30 to prevent premature aging.</p>
										<p>At Svetlana&#8217;s Skin Secrets we will develop a treatment regimen
											specifically for you, based on your age, skin type and personal
											expectations.</p>
