										<h2><strong>Do you want to remove your tattoo?</strong></h2>
										<p>Svetlana&#8217;s Skin Secrets Laser Aesthetics has over 15 years of
											experience in using advanced Q-Switched technology to efficiently remove
											tattoos, <a

												spots</a>, <a href={{ "treatments/sun-damage/" | relative_url }}>sun
												spots</a> and more. Q-Switched technology is one of the safest and
											efficient ways to remove tattoos.</p>
										<p>Ink colors have differences in light absorption, which means multiple
											wavelengths are needed to treat a colorful tattoo.</p>
										<p>Q-Swtched Nd:YAG 1064nm, the high power laser, is ideal for treating darker
											ink colors (black, blue and green, while the 532nm wavelength is effective
											for brighter ink color (red, orange and yellow). Tattoo removal light

											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>The high power Q-switched Nd:YAG has been the most frequently used
													laser for tattoo removal. With the Q-switched Nd:YAG laser available
													on the Harmony XL PRO laser system, you can effectively treat dark
													tattoo inks, specifically black (which accounts for more than half
													of all tattoos) and dark blue. The 532nm wavelength laser is
													effective to treat brighter ink colors (red, orange and yellow).</p>

											<div id="faq-Doesithurt" class="arconix-faq-title faq-closed">Does it hurt?
											</div>
											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>The sensation of laser tattoo removal is similar to the feeling when
													the tattoo was originally created. During the procedure you may feel
													a snapping sensation as the laser light is directed over the tattoo
													area.</p>
												<p>After your tattoo laser removal treatment, you can expect redness,
													heat, possible blistering, and itching for the next few days. We ask
													you keep the area covered for about a week with a protective
													dressing.</p>

											<div id="faq-Howdoeslasertattooremovalwork"
												class="arconix-faq-title faq-closed">How does laser tattoo removal work?
											</div>
											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>Tattoo removal lasers are absorbed by certain colors of tattoo ink
													while avoiding damage to surrounding skin tissue. Using a
													combination of laser wavelengths that target different ink colors,
													high-intensity light beams break up the ink particles in the tattoo,
													the tattoo is then dissolved into smaller ink particles that are
													harmlessly removed by the body’s immune system in revealing clear,
													ink-free skin with minimal risk of scarring or hypo-pigmentation.
												</p>
												<p>Successful multi-color tattoo removal requires a high powered laser
													that can deliver enough energy within the absorption spectrum of a
													wide range of colors. The high power Q-Switched Nd:YAG 1064nm laser
													is ideal for treating darker ink colors (black, blue and green),
													while the 532nm wavelength is effective for brighter ink colors
													(red, orange and yellow).</p>

											<div id="faq-Howlongdoesittake" class="arconix-faq-title faq-closed">How
												long does it take?</div>
											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>Depending on the color, type, depth, size of the tattoo the procedure
													is easy to administer and dramatic results can be achieved after a
													series of sessions.</p>
												<p>On average the treatment may take from 15 to 30 minutes and multiple
													treatments are often needed to achieve the desired results.
													Depending on the tattoo location, the skin takes four to six weeks
													to heal. Once the skin has fully healed, you can then undergo
													another treatment.</p>

											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>The art of placing a tattoo is an imperfect science. Ink is
													distributed to multiple layers of skin that is why multiple
													treatment sessions are needed to effectively eliminate a tattoo.</p>

											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>Average cost $100-$500</p>
												<p>However, every individual tattoo is different and treatments can vary
													greatly depending on how raised your tattoo is, how old it is, how
													light or dark it is, and many other factors</p>
												<p>The only way to evaluate the price is for us to evaluate it in person
													with a free consultation. We price according to the size of the
													area, but the number of treatments you require will vary based on
													your specific tattoo.</p>

											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>While laser tattoo removal is deemed as safe, some have adverse
													reactions ranging from change in skin texture, scarring, pigmentary
													changes and some can also have allergic reactions. If you have
													certain skin conditions, it is best to get the opinion of your
													practitioner before going in for tattoo removal.</p>

											<div id="faq-Willitbe100removed" class="arconix-faq-title faq-closed">Will
												it be 100% removed?</div>
											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>Q-Switched laser treatment can break up tattoo pigments so that it
													can be more easily removed through the body’s natural filtering
													system. Your skin will not look exactly as it did prior to getting a
													tattoo, but results for clear skin are a vast improvement.</p>

											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>The black-colored ink responds faster than the bright-colored inks
													but it is important to realize that the skin where the tattoo is
													removed from will never look exactly as it did before you had the
													tattoo placed.</p>
												<p>The art of placing a tattoo is an imperfect science. Ink is

											<div class="arconix-faq-content faq-closed">
												<p>Before and after any treatment session it is important to avoid
													direct sun exposure, hot tubs, pool water and salt water, tanning
													booths and self-tanners until tattoo is healed (roughly 1-2 weeks).
													AVOID HIGH-PRESSURE WATER ON THE TREATED AREA.</p>
												<p>Keep the treated area clean and dry while it is healing. Clean the
													area with antibacterial soap if needed and then pat the area dry.
